Is it possible to make the pi give the camera a static ip automatically upon booting?

Yes — the Raspberry Pi can automatically assign a static IP to the camera every time it boots, with no router, no switch, no DHCP server, no manual setup on the camera.

This is the cleanest, zero-maintenance solution for a Pi ↔ Reolink direct-connect setup.
And it works extremely well for your “self-contained hardware kit” concept.
There are two stable ways to do this:

✅ BEST METHOD (Recommended): Pi runs a tiny DHCP server
The Pi gives the camera an IP automatically each time both power up.

Why this is the best:
    The Pi assigns the IP even if the camera boots first.
    No need to program or manually configure the camera at all.
    The camera remains “factory default” and still gets an IP.
    Also works for any Reolink model without customizing per device.
    You maintain full flexibility for future devices.
    This adds very little complexity (one config file + a systemd service).

Method 1: Pi runs a minimal DHCP server (dnsmasq)
This is the approach used by embedded products that manage cameras or sensors.

1. Install dnsmasq
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install dnsmasq

2. Give the Pi a static IP on eth0

3. Configure dnsmasq to assign the camera its IP
Edit:
    sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

Add only these minimal lines:
    interface=eth0
    dhcp-range=192.168.0.100,192.168.0.110,255.255.255.0,24h
(optional) If you want a fixed IP for the Reolink camera based on MAC address:
    dhcp-host=ec:71:db:71:81:bd,192.168.0.100

🎉 Result

When you plug the Reolink camera directly into the Pi’s ethernet port:
    Pi binds to 192.168.0.1
    Pi automatically gives the camera an IP (e.g., 192.168.0.100)

    Camera is immediately accessible at:
        rtsp://admin:password@192.168.0.100:554/h264Preview_01_main
        http://192.168.0.100

    Every. Single. Boot.
    With zero extra hardware.

Disable DNS features (we only want DHCP)

    Add these lines:
        no-resolv
        no-hosts
        port=0

    This keeps dnsmasq ultra-minimal and DHCP-only.

Great — that explains exactly why eth0 never gets the IPv4 address you configured.

Because:
    dhcpcd is not installed, so its configuration file /etc/dhcpcd.conf is ignored
    systemd-networkd is active, so the Pi’s networking is managed by networkd
    dnsmasq is starting before eth0 has an IPv4 address → it crashes with
        unknown interface eth0

This means you should use systemd-networkd, not dhcpcd.
It’s cleaner, more robust, and already active on your system.

✅ FIX: Configure eth0's static IPv4 using systemd-networkd (recommended)

We will:
    Fully remove your dhcpcd changes
    Configure a proper static IP on eth0 with networkd
    Make dnsmasq wait for networking
    Confirm the camera receives DHCP from the Pi

STEP 1 — Remove the dhcpcd configuration you added
    Open the file:
        sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

    Delete the lines:
        interface eth0
        static ip_address=192.168.0.1/24

    Save & exit.

    Since dhcpcd isn’t installed or running, this file won’t be used — just cleaning up.

STEP 2 — Create a networkd config for eth0

    This file gives eth0 a static IPv4 address on every reboot, even if the camera isn’t plugged in.
        sudo nano /etc/systemd/network/10-eth0.network

    Add EXACTLY this:
        [Match]
        Name=eth0

        [Network]
        Address=192.168.0.1/24
        ConfigureWithoutCarrier=yes

    Important:
    ConfigureWithoutCarrier=yes ensures the Pi sets the IP even if the camera hasn’t powered up yet — solving your earlier race condition.

    Save and exit.

STEP 3 — Restart systemd-networkd
    Run:
        sudo systemctl restart systemd-networkd

    Then verify:
        ip addr show eth0

    You should now see:
        inet 192.168.0.1/24

    If yes — continue.

STEP 4 — Fix dnsmasq so it starts after eth0 is ready

    Edit dnsmasq service override:
        sudo systemctl edit dnsmasq

    Add:
        [Unit]
        After=systemd-networkd.service
        Requires=systemd-networkd.service

    Save.

    Reload systemd:
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload

    Restart dnsmasq:
        sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
        sudo systemctl status dnsmasq

    It should now start cleanly.

STEP 5 — Confirm the camera receives its DHCP IP

    Power-cycle the camera.

    Then check:
        arp -a

    You should see:
        ec:71:db:71:81:bd at 192.168.0.100

    Or check dnsmasq leases:
        cat /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases

    You should see something like:
        <timestamp> ec:71:db:71:81:bd 192.168.0.100 ...

🎉 Result

    After this:
        The Pi always assigns itself 192.168.0.1, reliably.
        dnsmasq waits for eth0 and runs correctly.
        The camera always gets 192.168.0.100 from DHCP.
        The setup is fault tolerant and reboots cleanly.

4. Which should you use for your Pi + camera setup?
    dnsmasq must not start until eth0 exists.

    If your Pi uses systemd-networkd, then the best practice dnsmasq unit override:
        [Unit]
        After=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
        Wants=systemd-networkd-wait-online.service


    Why this combination?
        It waits until networking is fully configured (IP assigned, interface up).
        But does NOT hard-fail if something small goes wrong.
        Much more reliable than just systemd-networkd.service.

    Do NOT use Requires here unless you want:
        A boot failure if networkd hits a transient race condition.
