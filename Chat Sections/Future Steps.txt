🛠 Deployment Tips for Pi 3B:
Use TFLite or ONNX for inference (not PyTorch directly)

Prune models and quantize to int8 for best performance

Consider OpenCV DNN module for running small models like MobileNet SSD

Would you like a script to test YOLOv5n or MobileNet SSD on your Pi 3B right now using your Reolink RTSP camera?


Would you like a script to:

Train a custom YOLOv5n model using v6.1 on your dataset?

Export to ONNX or TFLite for Pi inference?

Or maybe I can help you get started evaluating the speed of a pretrained YOLOv5n model on your Pi 3B?


Would you like a command to convert those YOLOv5 detections into timestamps (e.g. when a train was seen in the video)? Or export bounding box overlays frame-by-frame?


Let me know if you’d like a version of detect.py modified to:
Send alerts
Write detection timestamps
Call a REST API when trains are detected
Or run on live camera feeds (e.g. from your Reolink RTSP)


🧠 Optional: Add Attribution
Since the dataset is under CC BY 4.0, you just need to credit it somewhere in your project. A short line like this is enough:
“Model trained on the Railroad Car Detection dataset provided by Innopolis University via Roboflow Universe (CC BY 4.0).”

You can put that:
In your app’s "About" or Help section
In documentation or README
In a footer or web interface
